This repository is my portfolio of data science projects... It is a work in progress.


## About Me
I am a data analyst with a Master’s degree in Statistics and a strong background in applying data to solve real-world problems. Over the course of my career, I’ve specialized in fraud and risk analytics, using statistical modeling, data mining, and business intelligence tools to detect patterns, mitigate risk, and protect against financial loss.

Beyond fraud and risk, I bring expertise in turning complex datasets into actionable insights that inform strategy, improve efficiency, and drive measurable results. I have several years of professional experience using SQL, Python, Tableau and functions in Excel/Google Sheets along with academic experience in predictive modeling using common python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Seaborn, MatPlotLib and more)
